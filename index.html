		<h1>A Flying Carpet Adventure!</h1>

		<div id="content">
			<p>In this little VR world, you'll find yourself atop a magical flying carpet, in the beautiful city of Prague!
			You'll see that there are balloons flying into the air, try and grab (click!) one to see if you can pop them!
			There are also several ways to get quickly around on your carpet, just try clicking the rings (and fly through them!) or try
			to click any of the big cylinders coming out from the ground!</p>
